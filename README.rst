ImageMaze
=========

A game from Witsacco. Guess the pictures to help you finish a maze.


To Do
-----

* Finish multi-level play
* ImageCubes default to regular wall texture until images are loaded
* Build more mazes/levels
* Flip images so text is not backwards
* Figure out why you go into "hyper speed" when restarting at level 0
