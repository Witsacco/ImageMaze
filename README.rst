ImageMaze
=========

A game from Witsacco. Guess the pictures to help you finish a maze.


To Do
-----

* Load the wall textures for the maze on page load (but hidden) so that the user
  doesn't "lose time" when first starting the maze.
* If the user doesn't type any guesses for 10 seconds, prompt them to just start
  typing to guess the word!
* Make it clearer that the gold blocks are the end of the maze. Maybe there's an
  intro sequence?
